      <p > <em>  It has been my passion to know the ins and outs of how this marvelous world of computer Science works and  it had given me a great repository of knowledge of it
      in this pursuit. The cool looking guy with all those high tech machines surrounding him and him making hilariously suprising findings exhillarted me.I have equipped my repertoire of knowledge with great skills of technical analysis and logical
reasoning that use to concoct my code which results in great efficiency of the codeâ€™s execution
with the least complexity making the way I refactor my code more refined. <em> </p>
